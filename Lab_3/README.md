# Lab3

- Code for question 1.1 is put in the Code folder as q1_1.m
- Code for question 2 is put into the Code as two parts:   
q2_b_0 for zeroth order, q2_b_1 for first order interpolation    
In these codes, file path and value can be changed in order to plot all the 8 combinations
- Result (plots) for question 2_b are given as: q2_b_S_I_M
```
Where
S = signal (1 is q2_1.mat, 2 is q2_2.mat)
I = order of interpolation (0 is zeroth order, 1 is first order)
M = value of m (2,3)
```
