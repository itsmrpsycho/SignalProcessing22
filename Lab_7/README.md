# Lab7  
### Q1
Instead of combining all the parts of the quesiton, I have made the following:   
quadratic_quant.m : Contains the function used in this lab codes   
q1.m : Contains q1 - a,b,c,d parts (Requires one to manually change values of B to obtain different outputs)   
q1_e.m : Contains q1 - e part   
q1_f.m : Contains q1 - f part   
q2 : Contains q2   
-> Also the audio file used in this part is 'file_example_WAV_1MG.wav' from lab 6-q7
