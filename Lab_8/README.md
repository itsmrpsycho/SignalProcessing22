## Question 2
- q2_d has been split into two parts - a and b containing the two filters in parts q2_a and q2_b      
   This also is the case in the photos taken for these parts from fvtool which include:   
   Magnitude, phase, impulse responses, pole zero plot and step response in order   
   These are names as q2_d_X_Y   
   where X denotes part a/b and Y denotes the serial number of the picture   
- In order to change observe the IIR filter with different values of r0, the value of it needs to be updated in the code itself   

## Question 3
- A similar analogy (as used in q2_d) is used to name the results of q3_b, where it contains multiple plots
